Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. a programming language is a language that a program tell the computer what to do
What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK includes jdk and jre. JDK is the java development kit, while JRE is the java runtime environment.
JDK components are:
    1. Java compiler- compiles java lanaguage code into bytecode files
    2. java interpreter- is used to interpret the .java files which jave been compiled
    3. java disassembler- disassembly  tool that disassembles java files
    4. java header file generator- generates the c header and source files needed to implement methods and references object variables from source code.
    5. java documentation- documents Java source files, HTML pages defining the public/protected/nested classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields
    6. java debugger- command line debugger for java, inspect and debugs java virtual machine
    7. java applet viewer- views java applets
What is IDE?
A. IDE is integrated development environment where you write code and compile programs. Has text editors/interpreters/compilers
What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, Intellij and many more
Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. Create a .java file with the source code
what is class?
A. Class is a framework/blueprint for objects to be created of class type
What is object?
A. object is an instance of class
What is the entry point of an application?
A. Main()
Why main is static?
A. Main is static so JVM can call it without an object of the method existing.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. Object class is the superclass of all class
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path is used by the operating system/computer to locate java/java libraries while classpath is used by compiler to run classes
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Abstract class can never be instantiated and contains abstract methods.
Abstract classes are models for other classes to implement.
Interfaces contain method models and constant variables
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No you cannot. You implement interface methods and extend abstract classes and create a concrete class.
what is Access Specifier?
A. Can be public or private, determine who is allowed to access methods/data.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A.  Object-oriented programming. You program based on objects, which are classes.
 JAVA feature is encapsulation- data hiding, inheritance- inherit from parent/super class,
 polymorphism- child class refers to parent class & method overload ,
 abstraction- use abstract classes to extend and create concrete classes
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Package is namespace for related classes/interface. Packages imported by default is noname package, java langauage package and current file package.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application program interface provides programmers with tools/protocols/access needed to build software
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No, because need for simplicity and java will confuse which parent class method to use.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Method overloading is when a method uses different parameters, happens when more or less arguements are used
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. exceptions are declared events, and you can use exception handling to stop program
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. Static is a keyword, it denotes that you can access method/variable without creating object.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. final keyword, is a restriction that makes sure you cannot change value/overide method
What is final, finally and finalize?
A. final keyword cannot change value/override. Finally used in blocks to execute code and make system messages.
finalize- called when garbage collection occurs, when no references made to object
What is a constructor ?
A. constructor is used to create instance of a class, intialize object
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. yes you can
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. this, implicitly calls self
What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. represents instance of current class
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. super calls parent class, used to access methods
What is JVM stand for ?
A.Java virtual machine
Is JVM platform independent?
A. java is platform independent, can run on many systems/OSes/hardware
What version of java are you using?
A. jdk 10
What is JAR stand for ?
A. Java Archive
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. jdk is the development kit while jvm is a virtual machine
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. Jvm is a virtual machine and jre is the java runtime environment.
What is compile time and run time?
A. compile time is when your coded is being compiled from .java to .class,
run time is when you execute file in jvm
What is heap?
A. heap is memory area for objects and arrays, during runtime.
How java manage it's memory?
A. variables in stack, objects in heap, When reference variable is destroyed java automatically garbage collects
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. string is a class, string buffer and string builder are mutable can change values.
What is Singleton class?
A. Singleton classes are class that exist for a specific purpose, limit object to one instance.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. turn object into sequence of bytes sent in streams, deserialization is the reverse process
when to use transient variable in java?
A.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. while loop check exit condition then run/can be infinite loop,
do...while is run then check exit condition is achieved.
What is Enum?
A. enum is enumerated type. Used to signify values such as date/month
What is Iterator?
A. iterator is a variable used to count
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. Integer is class, int is primitive. integer takes more memory.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. Strings are immutable for security reasons
What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. Calling one constructor from inside another constructor
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. Serial is single thread, parallel is multi threaded
What is JIT stands for?
A. Just in time,
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. Objects stored in heap for runtime,
dereferenced objects are removed from heap during garbage collection
garabage collection frees up space
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. No, it is an automatic process.
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Heap space is larger than stack memory.
Heap stores objects, stack stores variables and call stack.
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Code that inspects other code,it is useful because
it allows you to get information on your interfaces/fields/methods
what is multithreading in java?
A. process of running multiple threads simultaneously.
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. synchronization in java is the ability to control multiple threads on shared resources
What is Framework?
A. frameworks are abstract programming classes that developers can extend or use to easily develop software
What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. testNG, and jUnit
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. jUnit uses object oreinted testing, and testNG use dependency testing.
What are the dependencies for this project?
A. ??????
what is dependency injection in java?
A. Dependency injection is when objects pass in dependencies externally, or dependencies are later applied through frameworks
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Static binding references are done during compiler time and dynamic binding references are done during runtime.
